# Cards

Cards are containers used to organize high-level content. Using cards can make your web product more appealing and navigable.

## Best Practices

A card should only contain a single idea and feature a call-to-action, typically a click to expand on the content. The content of a card should be concise, and offer only a preview of the page they navigate to or the action the user will be taking.

Cards should have a consistent size across the platform.

Cards are not always the best way to display information. Complex or compound information should not be displayed in a card. On mobile, improperly using cards can be detrimental to the user's ability to scan the page as drop-shadows can be distracting. 

Cards can make your web product more engaging. However, you should consider the type of information you are sharing, as well as how the user will be viewing this information before you decide to use a card.

### **Guide for creating a card's content**

Elements that can be used in a card are:

* Main Title - A short and clear label that states the card's main message.
* Meta information - Used to organize the cards. This can be a time stamp, category etc.
* Description - A more thorough explanation of the idea and call-to-action. This text should be brief. 
* Image or Rich Media - Associated with the card and text, an image or rich media should contribute to the message.
* Buttons - When a card requires a selectable action, or you want to emphasize that the card is a clickable object, you can use buttons.
* Extra information - Any additional information that enhances the message of the card.

Not all of these elements are necessary in every card. You can choose the elements which you think best fit the purpose of the card. However, every card should have a main title.

### Templates for cards

There are six templates that can be used for cards, choose the one that best fits the content you are displaying:

#### Basic card template

This template features all of the basic content elements. This template can be used for any card that does not require an action beyond clicking the card.

#### Basic card template variation

Similar to the basic card template, this variation has the majority of the basic content elements, however there is a greater emphasis on text over image. This template can be used for any card that does not require an action beyond clicking the card in which the image is less important.

#### Actionable card template

The actionable card template is for cards in which the user can take a primary or secondary action when interacting with the card.

#### Image card template

The image card template has a lot of visual impact. It's best used when an image can convey almost all of the message of the card.

#### Text card template

The text card template is content-dense. It's best used when a card needs to convey a lot of information, and doesn't have an image that can be easily associated with it.

### Sorting

A user should be able to sort and filter cards based on the card's metadata. This could include parameters such as date, file size etc.
