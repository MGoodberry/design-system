# Colour

## Best Practices

_**\(to move to research section once complete\)**_

### Accessibility

we should not look at individual colors and ask if they are ‘visible’, but rather look at groupings of colors, and see if they are distinguishable.

## The Colour Palettes

This color palette comprises primary and accent colors that can be used for illustration or to develop your brand colors. They’ve been designed to work harmoniously with each other. The color palette starts with primary colors and fills in the spectrum to create a complete and usable palette.

Themes enable consistent application styling through surface shades, shadow depth, and ink opacity.

### Sample Colour Palettes

### Applying Your Own Palettes

## Text Colours

### Black Text

Text in this design system is displayed using off-black. Black text can be used on any light background \(see: Light Theme\) or any button or element that uses a light colour. When adding text to any background that is not black, it is essential to check the contrast for accessibility. Significant contrast between the background/element colour and the text ensures readability, even for those with visual impairments such as colour blindness. 

Please see our typography section for more information about using text colour.

### White Text

Light text in this design system is displayed using an off-white colour. White text can be used on any dark background \(see: Dark Theme\) or any button or element that uses a dark or light colour. When adding white text, it is essential to check the contrast for accessibility. Significant contrast between the background/element colour and the text ensures readability, even for those with visual impairments such as colour blindness. 

Please see our typography section for more information about using text colour.

### Muted Text

Muted text is used for secondary text elements such as captions, placeholder text and timestamps. This muted text colour only works on light backgrounds \(see: Light Theme\) or light-coloured elements. For dark backgrounds or bright/dark elements, use white text.
