# Forms: Text Inputs

**Input fields** allow users to provide information by inputting text into a page. Information can be entered through a variety of different input fields such as text fields (text area), checkboxes, radio buttons, and date inputs. Input fields typically appear in forms and should clearly indicate that users can input information through labels, help text, placeholder text, and appropriate styling.

## Text Area

The text field a user has selected should indicated visually. Outlining the selected text box in blue shows the user which field they are inputting without too much visual weight.

When there is an error within a text field, outlining the field in red shows a greater level of significance than blue. 

## Date Boxes
