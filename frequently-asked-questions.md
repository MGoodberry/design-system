# Frequently Asked Questions

### What is a design system?

A design system is a catalogue of everything that makes up your digital product, including user interface elements, writing style, guiding principles, coding standards, visual design, etc. The system provides information about your product or set of products, and provides reusable components for easy development.

Building a design system is a collaborative effort and requires expertise across all fields in web and application design. A design system takes into account **all aspects **of the product and encompasses all levels of the user and the creator’s experience.

### Who created the \#GCDigital design system?

The \#GCDigital design system was a collaborative effort among various designers, developers and writers across the Government of Canada. Lead by the Digital Collaboration Division at the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat, the system was built in collaboration with the Canadian Digital Service; Talent Cloud; Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada; and other individuals in the Government of Canada.

### Who can use the \#GCDigital design system?

The \#GCDigital design system is open for anyone to use! It was originally created to help guide digital collaboration tools used within the Government of Canada, but the system can be adapted to create citizen-focused services or external digital products as well.

The design system is really a guide. Our team follows it closely for our products, but many elements can be modified to adapt to your own brand or product - only use the parts that are useful to you!

We recommend that in building a new product, you follow the system as closely as possible to begin with, then adapt certain elements \(i.e. colours, language style, icons\) to suit your own product or brand.

### Are there other design systems that exist in the public sector?

Although design systems are relatively new in the public sector, some government organisations have been working on them. For example, the Government of the United States of America released their [Web Design Standards](https://standards.usa.gov/), Italy's Design Agency has [Designers Italia](https://designers.italia.it/), and the Government of the United Kingdom is [currently building](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2017/10/30/building-the-gov-uk-design-system/) their own web standards.

In Canada, all official websites use the [Web Experience Toolkit](https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/government-communications/web-experience-toolkit.html), which is a more rigid style guide than this system, and the Canadian Digital Service is currently working on a [Government of Canada UI kit](https://github.com/cds-snc/gcui).

### Why did you create the \#GCdigital design system?

Here are some of the key reasons we are building this design system:

* Consistency across applications and platforms, particularly taking into consideration the rebuild of the GCTools or other digital collaboration services.

* Partnership opportunities with interested communities, both within and outside the Government of Canada.

* Saves development and design time since components are reusable and effectively organized. Would complement the agile development process by removing the need for multiple design and UI iterations.

* Specifications for designing new features are determined right from the start, so more time can be spent on business and complex decisions. Less focus on repetitive design problems throughout the process of new development.

* Ability to stay current with external design and technology trends, especially with rapid change in the industry.

### How is this design system different from current standards such as the Web Experience Toolkit \(WET\) or the Canada.ca style guide? How do they all work together?

The GCTools, as they stand today, were built using the WET framework. In doing a rebuild we wanted to have our own system or style guide that is more specific to our tools, including not just coding templates and components, but also design elements, our key principles, and communications guidelines. Each piece of the design system will also have extensive documentation on best practices and how and when to use each component or element we’ve provided.

This design system isn’t a direct alternative to WET or the Canada.ca Style Guide, but rather, follows the key principles and core concept of these existing style guides. We hope that as this project moves forward, we can also identify opportunities to work with developers who worked on WET to improve both systems.

### How did you build the design system?

The design system was built following the Digital Collaboration Division's existing agile development method. Following our two-week development sprints, we decided to start separate design sprints on the same cycle. Every two weeks we would pick a particular theme \(i.e. typography, forms\) to work on.

Pieces were first identified using a handy parts checklist, and were each listed as separate issues in Github. We then managed tasks using an online Kanban board. When files were completed, we uploaded them to our Github repository so they were easily accessible to all members of the team and other partners.

On an ongoing basis, work for the design system will be integrated into existing development cycles within the Digital Collaboration team.

### Are there files I can download and use?

Yes! Our design system includes a resources section and user interface \(UI\) kit. Here you can download Photoshop, Illustrator and Adobe XD files.

Some files include specific assets or typefaces. Others are full layouts, grids and prototypes.

### Is the code in this design system open source?

Yes! All aspects of the design system are open source and available for anyone to use. This includes all the code, documentation, design assets and download files. Our system was also created and shared using open source tools such as Github, Zube.io, Riot and Gitbook.
