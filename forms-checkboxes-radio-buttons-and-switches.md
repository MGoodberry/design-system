## Design

Forms should be designed vertically as this improves their scannability. When possible, a form should be one column.

## Labels

Labels should be designed with the user in mind. The user needs to be able to easily read the label and intuitively understand how the label is related to its field. 

### Placement of Labels

Labels should follow the vertical format of the form, and be placed above the field they are related to. Group a label with its field so that there is a clear distinction between fields. 

### Text in Labels



## Checkboxes

## 

## Radio Buttons

Radio buttons should follow the vertical format of the form i.e. they should be placed beneath each other rather than beside each other.

## Switches
