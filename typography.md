## Fonts

The Digital Collaboration Division uses two font families for all digital products. Both Montserrat and Muli are Open Source fonts which can be downloaded from Google Fonts for free.

Montserrat is used mainly for titles and headings, while Muli is used for sub-headings, buttons and paragraph text.

Unless otherwise indicated, all text types are displayed using pure black.

### About the Typefaces

**Montserrat** was designed by Julieta Ulanovsky and other collaborators. Through this font, Ulanovsky wanted to capture the traditional style found on signs and posters in the Montserrat neighbourhood of Buenos Aires, Argentina. The font was first developed in 2011 as a Kickstarter project and a full set  of weights and italics were developed in 2015. Montserrat works well as both a display font and a paragraph font and has been featured in over 4.3 million websites to date.

**Muli** is a minimalist sans-serif web font designed by Vernon Adams. Built primarily as a display font., Muli also works well for body text and has been used in over 500,000 websites. It was developed using an open source liscense and is particularly poplar in the United States.

## Titles

Titles appear only on the tops of pages, and indicate high-level navigation points. Titles are displayed using Montserrat Light at 36 points.

## Accessibility

## Headings

Including titles. there are six different heading types. H1 - H6. The headers use the following typographic styles:

Heading 1 \(Title\): Monteserrat Light at 36 points, with kerning/tracking modifier of -25.

Heading 2: Montserrat Light at 24 points.

Heading 3: Muli Semi-Bold at 18 points.

Heading 4: Muli at 16 points.

Heading 5: Muli Semi-Bold at 11 points. Uppercase text.

Heading 6: Muli Semi-Bold at 11 points. Sentence case.

## Paragraph Text

Paragraph text is used for most text content found on the application. Paragraph text is set to Muli Regular at 12 points, with a leading of 21 points. Unless indicating a hyperlink or navigation, paragraph text should not have added emphasis.

### Line-Breaking

The DCD design system, is consistent with the following best practices for line-breaks:

* Avoid hyphenation at the end of a line.

* Avoid leaving gaps or orphans hanging on a line.

* Avoid overly large indentation.

### Line Length

The ideal length for body text is around 40-60 characters. If line length is too short or too long, it has a negative impact on readability. Our design system follows these guidelines and aims for approximately 60 characters per line.
