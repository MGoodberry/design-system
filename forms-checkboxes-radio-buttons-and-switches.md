## Design

Forms should be designed vertically as this improves their scannability. When possible, a form should be one column.

## Labels

Labels should be designed with the user in mind. The user needs to be able to easily read the label and intuitively understand how the label is related to its field.

### Placement of Labels

Labels should follow the vertical format of the form. Place labels above the field they are related to. Group a label with its field so that there is a clear distinction between fields. Do not use placeholder text for labels as this prevents the user from properly reviewing the form.

### Text in Labels

How labels are written affects their legibility. Do not write labels in all caps as this diminishes their readability. Labels should not be the same as placeholder text, they should both be their own separate entity. Donâ€™t use symbols to represent optional content etc. write out the information, as the user may not understand what the symbol means.
