# Pagination/Scrolling

There are two ways to present content on a page: scrolling and pagination. Each has benefits and disadvantages, and you should pick the one which matches the type and context of the content you are presenting.

## Scrolling

Scrolling presents content on a single page, which the user proceeds through by moving up and down the page. Scrolling is best used when the content is a single and continuous piece, for example an article or tutorial. You should choose to use scrolling when the information is closely related and has the same level of **granularity \(plainer word?\).** It is easier for the user to scan the entire piece of content by scrolling rather than making them click to continue viewing the content. 

You should organize the page structure so that the most important information appears at the top; a brief description of the content at the beginning of the page gives the user an idea of what will appear further down, and gives them a reason to scroll.
