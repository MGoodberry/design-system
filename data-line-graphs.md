# Data: Line Graphs

## Run charts

Run charts are a type of line graph that are used to show changes in data over time. The time value should always be represented on the x-axis. Do not have more than three data sets shown the the graph, as your graph will become hard to read and process.

A useful feature to add to your run chart is the ability for users to zoom in and out to particular points of time represented on your graph. Adding markers for each data point make this easier to do.

### Multiple Data Series Run Chart

When using multiple data series in a run chart, include a legend. See [Legends and Tooltips](https://gctools-outilsgc.gitbook.io/-gcdigital-design-system/~/edit/primary/data-legends-and-tooltips) for more information.

## Area Graphs

Area graphs are line graphs that can be used to represent quantitative data. You can use a stacked area graph to represent a part-to-whole relationship between data series. Use a lower opacity if the series overlaps so all series can be seen.  Area charts can also be used to emphasize visual volume for a single data series of discrete objects.
