# Data: Line Graphs

## Legends

Legends... however, they should only be used as necessary. If the graph is only including one data set, don't add a legend. 

Legends should typically be aligned to the side of the graph, unless there is secondary axis in which case the legend should be placed at the bottom of the graph. 

Do not rely only on colour, different shapes can be used for individual data points to make the sets more distinguishable.

## Timelines \(or run charts? timeline is ambiguous\)

**Timelines** are a type of line graph that are used to show changes in data over time. The time value should always be represented on the x-axis. Do not have more than three data sets shown the the graph, as 

A great feature to add to your **timeline** is the ability for users to zoom in and out to particular periods of time represented on your graph.

## Area Graphs

\(Need image\)

* use for part-to-whole relationships
  * Cognitively implies relationship \(subtraction or addition\)

OR

* to show volume \(discrete objects\)
  * one or two objects \(too messy and hard to read otherwise\)
  * lower opacity \(should be able to see both\)
