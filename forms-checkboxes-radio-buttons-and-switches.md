# Button Inputs

## Checkboxes

Checkboxes are used when the user can select multiple options from the given list. They are also used to confirm certain statements such as: _I accept the Terms and Conditions,_ or _Send me email updates. _

If there is an _Other_ option, this should include an open field for users to provide additional information.

## Radio Buttons

Radio buttons are used when the user can only select one of the options from the given list.

Radio buttons should follow the vertical format of the form. They should be placed beneath each other rather than beside each other.

If there is an _Other_ option, this should include an open field for users to provide additional information.

## Switches

Switches are used for dichotomous questions or options. They represent simple questions such as yes/no or on/off style options. Typically, the yes/on option is more colourful and prominent than the no/off option.

Switches can be used in all kinds of forms, or other types of functions such as Settings, Profile Options etc.

## Buttons

Buttons in forms should clearly state the result of pressing the button. Especially in forms, the button should include some form of animation or validation to let the user know their action has been recieved \(i.e. a confirmation that the form has been submitted, saved, or cancelled\).
