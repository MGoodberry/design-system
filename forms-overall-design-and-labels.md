# Design and Labels

## Design

Forms should be designed vertically as this improves their scannability. When possible, a form should be one column.

## Labels

Users need to be able to easily read labels and intuitively understand how the label is related to its field. Labels should use clear but concise language and provide enough information for the user to accurately complete the required information.

If additional information is necessary beyond a label, this information should be displayed in a separate tooltip or text field. Additional information on how to complete the field might also be provided as placeholder text.

### Placement of Labels

Labels should follow the vertical format of the form. Place labels above their respective field. Group a label with its field so that there is a clear distinction between fields. Do not use placeholder text for labels as this prevents the user from properly reviewing the form.

### Text in Labels

How labels are written affects their legibility. Do not write labels in all caps as this diminishes their readability. Labels should not be the same as placeholder text, they should both be separate. Donâ€™t use symbols to represent required content.
