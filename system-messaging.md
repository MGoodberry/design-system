# System Notifcations

System notifications are short messages that appear to communicate information to the user. Notifications appear as pop-up banners which need to be dismissed or timed-out **\(time\).** There are four levels of severity which can be applied to the notifications.

Notifications in descending level of severity:

### Error

### Success

Success notifications are used to confirm that a task was completed successfully.

Success example: “Your password was updated successfully.”

## Style of Notifications

### Design

The notifications are designed with the same concept of simplicity found in the mood boards. There is enough colour in the banners to provide visual impact which catches the user’s attention, but not so much as to overpower the user’s **field of vision**.

The font icons are from Font Awesome, and were chosen due to their simple design and universality.

### **Needs subtitle**

A drop shadow is used to show the user that the notification can be closed by clicking the “X” button. The drop shadow has a 1px X-axis, a 1px Y-axis and an opacity of 23%.

### **Colours**

The colours used for notifications are from the design system’s palette. **\(Should we say why for each colour?\)**

Hex colour for error notifications: \#D3080C

Hex colour for warning notifications: \#FF9900

Hex colour for information notifications: \#269ABC

Hex colour for success notifications: \#278400

### **Position**

Notifications should be located at the top **\(right? Left? Does it matter?\)** of the page, or wherever is most convenient and visible for the user. **\(can we add more to this?\)**

### **Font**

The font used for notifications is the design system standard font Nunito Sans Regular. The notification title is in black \(**off-black?\)** and 16px in size. The notification message is in black and 14px in size. The font sizes were chosen for high visibility and easy readability. However, the size of the font may vary based on the display size, device used or how long the notification message is.

### **Size and padding**

Notifications are 62px by 425px. The text has a 15px padding on the top and on the bottom, and a 30px padding from the left. The corners are rounded to 2px. Padding sizes can vary based on how long the message will be. Padding is used to make text more pronounced in order to separate the message content from the background content.

### **Notification Messages**

The notification messages should straightforward and as short as possible, and use key words. Long messages can be unclear, and may affect the sizing and readability of the message.

Example of a clear notification: Your profile picture has been changed successfully.
