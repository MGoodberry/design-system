# Data: Line Graphs

## 

## Timelines \(or run charts?\)

Timelines are a type of line graph that are used to show changes in data over time. The time value should always be represented on the x-axis.

A great feature to add to your timeline is the ability for users to zoom in and out to particular periods of time represented on your graph. 

## Area Graphs

* two objects \(too messy and hard to read otherwise\)
* lower opacity \(should be able to see both\)



* use for proportional relationships 
  * Cognitively implies relationship \(subtraction\)

OR

* to show volume \(discrete objects\)
