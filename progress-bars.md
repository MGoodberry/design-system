# Progress Bars

Progress bars are key for visibility of system status. They visually represent a path to completion of a particular task or process. Progress bars help the user identify how much of the process they've completed, and how much is still left.

Progress bars are used for tasks that require multiple steps. To indicate a page or element that is loading, use a [spinner](/iconography.md) rather than a progress bar.

If a label is required for your progress bar, the label should be placed at the top of the progress bar and left-aligned.

Progress bars should always include a text indicator as well as the visual bar. This text should be included in the &lt;alt&gt; tag.

Colours for your progress bar can vary, but ensure that contrast requirements are met. Visit the [colour section](/colour.md) for more information on choosing accessible colours.
