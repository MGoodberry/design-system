<h3> A Stunning Comeback to an Elite Sport </h3>
    <p class="stamp"> Posted yesterday </p>
<p> The official line on Marie-Eve Chainey in the women’s high jump read “NH” – shorthand for “No Height” – not exactly a fitting designation for an athlete who truly soared.
    <br>
    <br>
For some athletes at the Canadian track and field championships in August 2010, a triumphant return meant posting fast times after a slow season. For Chainey, it meant returning to an elite competition after a nine-year battle with kidney disease. Three years ago, she was unable to walk and even lacked the strength to wash her hair. 
    <br>
    <br>
As a 14-year-old, Chainey would often travel 820 kilometres from Kapuskasing to Toronto to train under coach Gary Lubin at York University. At 18, Chainey went to Spain to learn the language and continue her high-jump training. While there, she became so dizzy she had to be hospitalized. That’s when she got the news: Her kidneys were no longer working. She hasn’t known life without dialysis since. 
    <br>
    <br>
Healthy kidneys filter waste products from the blood. In dialysis treatment, a machine cleans the blood at regular intervals, for example, three times a week. Chainey has been using nocturnal dialysis, which works while she sleeps.
    <br>
    <br>
Since her original diagnosis, Chainey has had to overcome four relapses and countless other obstacles, including going blind for two months. She was told over and over she’d never jump again because her muscles were too damaged. But for Chainey, jumping is like breathing.
    <br>
    <br>
“From when I got sick, the goal was that I had to just be back jumping,” she said. “Jumping was basically my happy place. Even more so now. Because I’m sick and there’s so much going on, when I go to high jump, I don’t think about anything else than just high jump and enjoying it. It is definitely my getaway. I feel normal because I don’t have to think about anything else”
    <br>
    <br>
So on the eve of the national championships, the 27-year-old was not about to be deterred by a difficult night of dialysis. “I’m very stubborn, I’m very hard-headed … I just had to find a way that I would be able to jump, no matter what.”
    <br>
    <br>
Chainey certainly felt jitters at the championships; her hands wouldn’t stop shaking once the competition began. She didn’t clear the starting height of 1.50 metres, which she had managed to get over in practice. Still, you’d be hard pressed to find a happier last-place finisher anywhere.
    <br>
    <br>
“Just being out there, especially when they lined us up and they introduced us to the crowd, it was a special moment that I’ll always remember,” she said. “I didn’t feel comfortable at first because I didn’t feel I belonged. But although I didn’t get a height, I still feel I belonged there. It felt awesome just to have the opportunity and experience this.”
    <br>
    <br>
Chainey says kidney disease has cured her of her perfectionism. “I’ve always been a straight A student, always done well in sports and piano,” she said. “So when I got sick, my life wasn’t perfect anymore. I had to learn how to live with what you have, that I had limits. That was a very good lesson for me, to know that things aren’t always perfect but you can still make the best of it.”
    <br>
    <br>
Lubin is not surprised by her determination. “She used to come down from Kapuskasing, a 12-hour train ride … in order to train. When I talk to my athletes about dedication, I say, ‘Don’t tell me you come from Burlington. You think that’s far? How about Kapuskasing?’ This is the type of person she is.”

There are comebacks, and there are comebacks.
