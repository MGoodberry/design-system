## Design

Forms should be designed vertically as this improves their scannability. When possible, a form should be one column. 

## Labels

Labels should be designed so that the user can easily read and understand how they related to the field. They should follow the vertical format of the form and be placed above the field they are related to. 



Labels should be grouped with their field so that there is a clear distinction between fields. 



As well, labels should not be written in all caps as this decreases readability. 

## Checkboxes

## Radio Buttons

Radio buttons should follow the vertical format of the form i.e. they should be placed beneath each other rather than beside each other.
