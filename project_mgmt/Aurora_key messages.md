- Aurora has gained interest from governments around the world and within Canada (e.g. British Columbia, New Zealand, UK) 
- Aurora was built by a multidisciplinary team that works with an agile development process. 
- Using Aurora is complementary to the Web Experience Toolkit (WET), Canada.ca Style Guide, the Federal Identity Policy (FiP) and WCAG 2.1. 
- Aurora is subject to improvements and further iterations.
