# \#GCDigital Design System

The Digital Collaboration Division \(GCTools\) will be building a design system to inform and standardize the rebuild of our digital products \(micro-services\).

This design system will be built in collaboration with multiple teams and departments \(Canadian Digital Service, Talent Cloud, IRCC\), and will be available for any Government of Canada or external teams that wish to use the system to build their own products.
