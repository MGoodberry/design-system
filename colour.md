## The Colour Palettes

This color palette comprises primary and accent colors that can be used for illustration or to develop your brand colors. They’ve been designed to work harmoniously with each other. The color palette starts with primary colors and fills in the spectrum to create a complete and usable palette. 

Themes enable consistent application styling through surface shades, shadow depth, and ink opacity.

## Best Practices

### Accessibility

we should not look at individual colors and ask if they are ‘visible’, but rather look at groupings of colors, and see if they are distinguishable.
