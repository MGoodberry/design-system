# Nav: Tabs

## Usage

Tabs organize navigation by dividing related content into separate views in a single row. This allows users to quickly and easily navigate between the content.

## Best Practices

Tabs should appear in a single, non-scrollable \(i.e., fixed\) row above their associated content. The categories should be of equal importance. Tabs with related content should be grouped next to each other.

An **active tab** \(i.e., a ****tab that is selected\), will display a coloured underline and a grey box around the label text. **Inactive tabs** will appear greyed out.
