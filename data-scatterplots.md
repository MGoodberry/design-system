# Data: Scatterplots

Always start your y-axis at 0. 

Trend lines aren't necessary, but may help to emphasize correlations in your data. Only use trend lines if they accurately represent a strong correlation. 

To show clusters of data, use varying opacity levels on your data points to visually show layers.
