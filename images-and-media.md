## Avatars

Avatars are square, small images used to identify users on the site or application. Avatars are often combined with the user's profile and other components such as cards, comments, and buttons.

Avatars are used in three sizes:

**Small:** Used in combination with other components such as comments, chat, cards and anywhere else you would need to identify the user.

**Medium:**

**Large**: Used directly on the user's profile

Avatars use the default image _**\(include here\)**_

When users upload their avatar, they are prompted to crop the image to fit into the avatar's dimension. 

## Thumbnails

Thumbnails are small versions of an image that are used as previews to content. They are often combined with other components such as cards, comments, image previews, etc.

Thumbnails are always square and \_**\(size\). **\_They do not crop the image but simply re-scale it. Thumbnails are typically left-aligned when combined with other components.
