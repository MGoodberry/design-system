# GCDigital Design System

## Preface

The Digital Collaboration Division \(GCTools\) is building a design system to standardize the visual language and user experience of our digital collaboration tools. The system will encompass visual elements, components and communications.

This project is happening parallel to the rebuild of our digital products, including moving our suite of tools to a micro-service architecture. These projects will inform each other and work together to update the developmental framework, user interface and design of our tools.

The design system project was started by the Digital Collaboration Division (GCTools) in collaboration with with multiple teams and departments:
* Canadian Digital Service
* Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada, 
* Talent Cloud, and 
* TBS Interoperability.
* any Government of Canada or external teams

## What is a design system?

A design system standardizes the visual language and user experience of our digital collaboration tools. It is a catalogue of everything that makes up your digital product, including UI elements, writing style, guiding principles, coding standards, visual design, etc. The system provides information about your product or set of products, and provides reusable components for easy development.

Building a design system is a collaborative effort and requires expertise across all fields in web/application design. A design system takes into account all aspects of the product and encompasses all levels of the user and the creatorâ€™s experience. 

## Mission

Ensure a seamless experience for users across platforms that is easy to use, and quick for developers and designers to implement. The design system will provide a basic framework with guiding principles and components, with the ability to be adapted to other brands and needs. 

## Guiding Principles
Simple and flexible: a lightweight system that allows individual teams to adapt branding and other design elements to suit a specific project. The system will provide guidelines for all necessary elements without being restrictive.
Fun to use: the system itself will have a pleasing design that is easy for developers and designers to navigate and adapt to their needs. Using the system will make their jobs easier rather than add an extra burden or obligations to follow.
Re-usable: all components and principles included in the design system are generic enough to suit a variety of needs for multiple teams. Code and design elements can easily be extracted to create new products. Communications guidelines are easy to understand and follow.
Diverse: The design system will cover a variety of needs and types of products. The system will also cover necessary government obligations such as official languages and accessibility.
Technology agnostic: the design system is applicable regardless of which technology framework the team decides to use for their project.
Open: the design system will be open and accessible to anyone who wishes to use it. All code is open source, and other guidelines and elements are free to copy.

## Why do we want to build one? 

* Consistency across applications and platforms, particularly taking into consideration the rebuild of the GCTools or other digital collaboration services. 
* Partnership opportunities with interested communities, including the Canadian Digital Service, Talent Cloud, other teams in CIOB, and the design team at IRCC. 
* Saves development and design time since components are reusable and effectively organized. Would complement the agile development process by removing the need for multiple design and UI iterations.  
* Specifications for designing new features are determined right from the start, so more time can be spent on business and complex decisions. Less focus on repetitive design problems throughout the process of new development. 
* Ability to stay current with external design and technology trends, especially with rapid change in the industry.
