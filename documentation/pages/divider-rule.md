# Divider/Rule

Dividers are used to separate content on a page, and are used primarily to break up long pages of text, or to separate titles from other content. 

For cards and other content, the divider is the length of the card with padding set to 100% of the container width. Dividers are 1px wide and coloured at \#666666. 

Dividers are only placed on the top of content and not underneath.
