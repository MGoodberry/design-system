# Menus

Menus are used to display lists of choices the user can select \(**parallelism?**\). Menus can be used for both lists of actions, as well as a form of navigation.

## Best Practices

-must contain at least two items

-menu items are a single line of text -- may also contain icons, and checks for multiple items or states \(do we want two different symbols for this?\)

-Ordering -- static vs dynamic

-Nesting -- no more than one level, ideally

-location -- top level \(emitting element -- for context\)

-Dismissing -- click outside, or select item \(not if multiple items can be selected\)

## Action Menus \(need different name\)

-temporary

-interaction w/control

-discrete

-scroll internally

-disabled are still shown, just unclickable

#### Labels

-concisely and accurately

#### Contextual

-dynamic

### Cascading Menus

-desktop

#### Inline

### Simple Menus

-mobile or tablet

-vertical

-nesting is vertically aligned on top of selected item

-left aligned

## Navigation Menus

### Menu Bar \(merge w/tabs? or vice versa?\)

### Mega-menus

-type of expendable menu

-**subcategories** \(what makes it different from other menus\)

-two dimensional, groups of navigation items

-structured

-static

-everything is visible at once

#### Timing

### Static \(merge w/sidebar? or vice versa?\)

## Hybrid
