# Data: Legends and Tooltips

In general, legends and tooltips should only be used on visualizations when absolutely necessary. If enough context can provided directly on the chart without obscuring data or adding a significant amount of visual clutter, a legend or tooltip is not necessary.

Never use a key if you only have one data category.

## Legends

 they should only be used as necessary. If the graph is only including one data set, don't add a legend. 

Legends should typically be aligned to the side of the graph, unless there is secondary axis in which case the legend should be placed at the bottom of the graph. 

Do not rely only on colour, different shapes can be used for individual data points to make the sets more distinguishable.
