# Grids and Spacing

This design system uses the same grid framework as the [Web Experience Toolkit](http://wet-boew.github.io/wet-boew-styleguide/v4/design/grids-en.html), which was based on the [Bootstrap framework](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/grid/#grid-options) to create page layouts. These systems include responsive grids, including sizes for mobile, tablets and desktops, and is built using flexboxes and containers.

The grid framework contains 12 columns that scale according to the viewport of the user's device. Further customization of grids and column layouts, such as offsetting and nesting, is possible through the Web Experience Toolkit's framework.
