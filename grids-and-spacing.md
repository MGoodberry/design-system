# Grids and Spacing

This design system uses the same grid framework as the [Web Experience Toolkit](http://wet-boew.github.io/wet-boew-styleguide/v4/design/grids-en.html), which was based on the [Bootstrap framework](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/grid/#grid-options). These systems include responsive grids, including sizes for mobile, tablets and desktops and is built using flexboxes and containers.
