## Usability

Usability is just one aspect of a user's overall experience with a product. Usability assesses how easy user interfaces are to use, which is usually determined by a usability test. Usability is defined by 5 components: learnability, efficience, memorability, errors, and satisfaction. Usability tests usually focus on specific tasks, and determine the efficiency and the ease of which users can complete them.

User experience encompasses all aspects of a person's feelings about using a product, including their understanding of the product, the context in which they are using it, how well it meets their needs, and the enjoyment or frustration that comes from using the product.
