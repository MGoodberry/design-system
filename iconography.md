# Icons

Icons in this system use .svg icons from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/).

_**\(.svg v. icon font\)**_

Icons are used for certain buttons, and are usually associated with some sort of action.

Icons can also add visual diversity to your page.

\(_**add notes about accessibility\)**_

## Loading/Spinner

The spinner uses the [_spinner_ icon](https://fontawesome.com/icons/spinner?style=solid)  from Font Awesome. Font Awesome provides [multiple icons](https://fontawesome.com/icons?c=spinners) that may work well as spinners, depending on your content. You can refer to [Font Awesome's documentation](https://fontawesome.com/how-to-use/svg-with-js) to animate the spinner to demonstrate a loading page.
