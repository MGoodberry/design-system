## Prototype
Prototypes can be low or high fidelity. Fidelity refers to how closely the prototype mimics the final product, with high fidelity often including development work. A prototype is a stylized and more complete version of a wireframe, that shows features and interfaces as they would appear to the user on-screen. Both low and high fidelity prototypes are used after wireframe testing, and are often used for usability or A/B testing. 

## Usability

Usability is just one aspect of a user's overall experience with a product. Usability assesses how easy user interfaces are to use, which is usually determined by a usability test. Usability is defined by 5 components: learnability, efficience, memorability, errors, and satisfaction. Usability tests usually focus on specific tasks, and determine the efficiency and the ease of which users can complete them. 

## User Interface Design

User interface design refers to the front-end of a system, or, the elements in which a user will interact with on the page. User interface design incorporates styled elements to create the aesthetic appearance of the website or application. Development for the user interface usually happens in conjunction with or after testing has been done on application prototypes, and is usually done using HTML and CSS. User interface design plays a role in the overall experience of the user. 

Mobile user interface focuses on the appearance and usability of mobile applications. 

## User Experience

User experience is a broader concept than user interface or usability. Although both of these are important aspects of an overall user experience, the term refers to a person's overall emotions and attitudes about using a product, system or service. User experience encompasses all aspects of a person's feelings about using a product, including their understanding of the product, the context in which they are using it, how well it meets their needs, and the enjoyment or frustration that comes from using the product. 

## Utility

Utility refers to whether or not a product provides the features needed by definied users. If the product or system provides all the features required for users to meet their goals, it has a high level of utility. 

## Wireframe

Wireframes are basic black and white samples of a new feature or interface. Often using placeholder content, and simple boxes and outlines, wireframes are not fully representative of the final product. Wireframes can be designed digitally or on paper, and are meant to be used early in the user experience research and design process.
