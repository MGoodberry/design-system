# Bar Graphs

Bar graphs should be used to represent direct comparisons. Numerical values should always be shown beside visual elements.

Bars should be twice as wide as the space between them. 

In bar graphs each variable should consistently be represented using one colour. Negative bars should use the same colour but at 60% opacity.  Multiple colours can be used if there is more than one variable, but each variable has its own colour.
