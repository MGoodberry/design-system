# Content Guidelines

## Reading Level and Plain Language

Plain language is achieved through several techniques:

* **Write in short sentences** Aim for 15-20 words per sentence, but also ensure that sentence lengths vary to maintain flow. Sentences should incorporate only one main idea or point. 

* **Use the active voice.** The active voice is closer to the way we talk, and is more dynamic and easy to read. Active voice typically follows the structure of - the subject (noun) does (verb) what/where (object). One good rule is to remember that things don't happen to people, people DO things. Using the active voice is also a great way to reduce your word count. 

* **Avoid jargon that your reader won't understand.** This doesn't mean that you need to eliminate jargon entirely, but only use words that you know your reader will understand. Avoid buzzwords or words that only make sense to a very specific audience. 

* **Give short but clear directions.** These directions should be in the active voice, and as direct as possible. Refrain from being overly polite in instructions. Users need to know what to do, without ambiguity. Directions such as "Download the album", or "Read the job poster," are far easier to understand than. "You can download the album," or, "users are advised to read the job poster".

* **Use headings and lists.** Headings and lists make the content easy to scane, and provide users clues as to where to find the information they are looking for. Typically users don't visit a page to read everything, they are looking for one specific piece of information. Make it easy for them to find. Headings and lists are also great to break down different ideas in a blog or article. 

* **Write informative hyperlinks.** Tell users where they are going to land when they click the link. Avoid using hyperlinks with text such as "Click here" or, "on this page". Be clear in what content the reader will see when they click a link. Good link examples include "my new blog about leadership", or "the ATIP policy document". 

## Spelling
All language and content in the system uses **Canadian** spelling. The [Canadian Press Stylebook](http://www.thecanadianpress.com/writing-guide/stylebook/) or [Canadian Press Caps and Spelling](http://www.thecanadianpress.com/writing-guide/caps-spelling/) is a good resource for spelling, grammar and writing style in the Canadian context. 

## Addressing Users

Speak to users as if they are the main reader. Use pronouns such as "you" and yours, and use verbs that give direction, such as "download", "submit" or "save". Never refer to users in the third person. All system messaging should focus on the user.
