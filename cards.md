# Cards

Cards are containers used to organize high-level content. Using cards can make your web product more appealing and navigable.

## Best Practices

A card should only contain a single idea and feature a call-to-action, typically a click to expand on the content. The content of a card should be concise, and offer only a preview of the page they navigate to or the action the user will be taking.

Cards should have a consistent size across the platform.

Cards are not always the best way to display information. Complex or compound information should not be displayed in a card. On mobile, using cards can be detrimental to the user's ability to scan the page as drop-shadows can be distracting.

### **Guide for creating a card's content:**

* Main Title - A short and clear heading
* Meta information or subtitle - Time stamp, category etc.
* Description - A more thorough explaination of the idea and call-to-action. This text should still be brief. 
* Image or Rich Media

### Templates for cards

There are six templates that can be used for cards, choose the one that best fits the content you are displaying:

#### Basic card template

This template features all of the basic content elements. This template can be used for any card that does not require an action beyond clicking the card.

#### Basic card template variation

Similar to the basic card template, this variation has the majority of the basic content elements, however there is a greater emphasis on text over image. This template can be used for any card that does not require an action beyond clicking the card, in which the image is less important.

#### Actionable card template

### Sorting

A user should be able to sort and filter cards based on the card's metadata. This could include parameters such as date, file size etc.
