# Data Visualizations

Data visualizations come in many forms, and are a visual means to represent a data set. The type of data visualization chosen should always be appropriate for the type of data used.

Data visualizations should aim to represent and answer one question. The goal is to provide a brief overview of the data, and tell a visual story that makes sense to the user. Graphs should be used to visually represent datasets in ways that tables cannot. If the data is easy to understand without a visualization, usually the simplest option \(a table\) is best.

## Simplicity

A general rule for data visualizations is to keeps the visual elements as simple as possible. Only necessary information such as labels, values, and bars or lines should be present. A key or legend should be provided for more complex data that may have multiple colours or types of information. Colours and other visual elements should always be kept to a minimum when possible.

Visuals should only enhance the data, and should never distract. Best practices include eliminating backgrounds, lightening grids, and reducing the number of colours used in a graph.

If one graph is too complex to represent a certain dataset, the data should be represented in multiple, simple graphs.
