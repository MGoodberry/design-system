## Buttons

## Best Practices

**\(to be moved to research section once button documentation is complete\)  
**

Buttons tend to have visual prominence on any given page or window. Primary buttons, buttons that indicate a call to action, are the most prominent. Buttons are placed where a user should expect them, i.e. in close proximity to the other elements that the action affects.

This design system uses \(raised?\) buttons with \(rounded, square\) corners.

Icon buttons or buttons with a dedicated shortcut \(i.e. Ctrl + S for Save\) should include a tooltip in the hover state.

## Size and Padding

Buttons used in this design system have a minimum size of 10mm x 10mm because this is the typical size of a user's finger pad when using the application on mobile. For web this minimum size is also consistent.

The more white-space around a button, the more prominent the button is on the page.

### Labels

Button labels should be clear and specific. Avoid generic terms like Save, Submit or Cancel. Buttons should indicate the exact action that is taken and should provide a clear idea of what happens next.

Examples of good button labels:Add a blog post, Send message, Back to menu.

All labels should capitalize only the first letter of the label.

Label text has high contrast with the button colour. See below for specific text colours for each type of button.

### Varying States

All buttons include a hover state, tap state and active \(pressed\) state.

Every action taken by the user will provide a user interface reaction \(colour/animation\)

## Primary Buttons

Primary buttons are meant to identify calls-to-action. Use these buttons for actions that a user is encouraged to take such as Add a blog post, Send message, or Login.

Primary buttons are designed to have high contrast against the background and the strongest visual weight. They typically use brighter colours than other elements on the form or layout, and are located in a visible and accessible area of the page.

### Position

Primary buttons should be located in the most prominent and convenient location possible. These buttons should also be located in close proximity to the form or the elements that are affected by the action. Primary buttons should be placed to the \(right/left?\) of secondary buttons.

## Secondary Buttons

Secondary buttons are used for actions that are necessary to provide, but that users may click less often. Examples include actions such as Cancel submission, Delete or Back to menu. These buttons have a visual weight that is equal to or less than the majority of elements on the page. The secondary button is usually placed in close proximity to the primary button.

Secondary buttons, particularly ones used for destructive actions, should be designed in a way that deters users from clicking on it. This helps minimize mistakes.

For more permanent secondary actions, such as Delete, clicking the button may bring the user to a second window to confirm the action.

### Position

Secondary buttons are usually in close proximity to the primary button, but not in a location where the user might mistake the two. Secondary buttons are usually placed to the \(left/right?\) of the primary button.

## Split Buttons

## Menu Buttons

## Icon Buttons

i.e in WSIWYG editor, Like button, share button

Icon buttons should display a label in the hover state with tooltip text \(i.e. Share when hovering over a \(share icon\)\).
