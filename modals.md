# Modals

Modals are overlay messages that show users information on the page they are on. They should be used for actions or information that the user must acknowledge before proceeding. Modals prevent the user from accessing the parent page until the modal has been clicked out of or dismissed.

## Types of Modals

Alerts

Simple Menus

Confirmation

## Best Practices

Modal text should be short and precise so that the user clearly knows what the modal is stating or asking. The title should appear at the top, with the action button appearing on the bottom. The title can be a question or not, depending on the context. The action button should clearly state the action the user will be taking, for example "cancel and delete" vs "no and yes".
