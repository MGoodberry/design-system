## Fonts

The Digital Collaboration Division uses two font families for all digital products: Rubik and Nunito Sans. Both Rubik and Nunito Sans are Open Source fonts which can be downloaded from Google Fonts for free.

Rubik is used mainly for titles and headings, while Nunito Sans is used for sub-headings, buttons and paragraph text.

Unless otherwise indicated, all text types are displayed using **\(colour\)**.

### Font Choice

Both fonts chosen for this design system enhance accessibility and readability. Since sans-serif fonts have a simpler structure, users with reading disabilities or visual impairments are able to easily decipher characters.

 If you choose to use fonts other than the ones listed here, it is recommended that your digital product use sans-serif rather than serif or script fonts.

Some systems may not be able to download or display the fonts in this design system. This may be for a variety of reasons, including firewall restrictions, accessibility settings, etc. In this case, your application should be set to use the browser's default font. 

### About the Typefaces

**Rubik **is a sans-serif font designed by Philipp Hubert and Sebastian Fischer for the Chrome Cube Lab project. With 5 different weights, Rubik works well as a paragraph or display font. Rubik is popular internationally and has been used on more than 180,000 websites.

**Nunito Sans **is part of Google's _superfamily_ typefaces. It was created by Vernon Adams and improved by Jacques Le Bailly to include a full set of weights. This font is popular all over the world and is used in 50,000 websites.

## Titles

Titles appear only on the tops of pages, and indicate high-level navigation points.

Titles are displayed using Rubik Light at 36 points.

## Headings

Including titles. there are six different heading types. The headers use the following typographic styles:

Heading 1 \(Title\): Rubik Light at 36 points.

Heading 2: Rubik Regular at 21 points, with a tracking modifier of 50 points.

Heading 3: Rubik Medium at 18 points, with a tracking modifier of 50 points.

Heading 4: Rubik Regular at 16 points.

Heading 5: Nunito Sans Regular at 14 points. All caps.

### Line-Breaking

The DCD design system, is consistent with the following best practices for line-breaks:

* Avoid hyphenation at the end of a line.

* Avoid leaving gaps or orphans hanging on a line.

* Avoid overly large indentation.

### Line Length

The ideal length for body text is around 40-60 characters. If line length is too short or too long, it has a negative impact on readability. Our design system follows these guidelines and aims for approximately 60 characters per line.

## Links

Link text is used within paragraphs to indicate hyperlinks and navigation. Links use **\(font, size, modifiers**\). It is recommended that the link text be underlined and displayed in a secondary colour used in the application.

## Emphasis

For accessibility purposes, colour cannot be the sole source of emphasis. Be sure to add emphasis to text by making the font bold and increasing contrast as well.

Typographic formatting such as italics or underlining should be used sparingly and only when they genuinely enhance communication with all readers.

## Timestamps and Placeholder Text

Timestamps and placeholder text use the same typographic styles. Both use Nunito Sans Regular at 10 points with a tracking modifier of 50 and leading of 21 points. Timestamps and placeholder text uses a lighter font colour with a hex code of \# 808285

## Button Text

Button text is displayed as Nunito Sans Bold at 14 points. The colour of this text depends on the button and must provide enough contrast with the colour chosen for each type of button. For colour choice, please see our button section.
