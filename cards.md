# Cards

Cards are containers used to organize high-level content. Using cards can make your web product more appealing and navigable.

## Best Practices

A card should only contain a single idea and feature a call-to-action, typically a click to expand on the content. The content of a card should be concise, and offer only a preview of the page they navigate to or the action the user will be taking.

Cards are not always the best way to display information. Complex or compound information should not be displayed in a card. On mobile, using cards can be detrimental to the user's ability to scan the page as drop-shadows can be distracting.

_**Sizing**_

-sizing should be consistent

### **Guide for creating a card's content:**

* Main Title - A short and clear heading
* Meta information or subtitle - Time stamp, category etc.
* Description - A more thorough explaination of the idea and call-to-action. This text should still be brief. 
* Image or Rich Media

### Sorting

A user should be able to sort and filter cards based on the card's metadata. This could include parameters such as date, file size etc.
