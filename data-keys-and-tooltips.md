# Data: Keys, Legends and Tooltips

In general, keys and tooltips should only be used on visualizations when absolutely necessary. If enough context can provided directly on the chart without obscuring data or adding a significant amount of visual clutter, a key or tooltip is not necessary.

Never use a key if you only have one data category.
