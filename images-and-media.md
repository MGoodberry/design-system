## Block Images

Block images are separated from other elements on the page \(i.e. text\) and are typically centered with a set padding. In a layout including text, the text will continue on the next line after the image.

## Inline Image

Inline images are aligned vertically with other elements on the page \(i.e. text\), and may be left or right aligned. Inline images only have specified padding for left and right borders. They flow along with text content, and the text will be wrapped around the remaining space around the image.

## Full Width Image

Full-width images extend  from one end of the content area to the other. 

## Avatars

Avatars are square, small images used to identify users on the site or application. Avatars are often combined with the user's profile and other components such as cards, comments, and buttons.

Avatars are used in three sizes:

**Small:** Used in combination with other components such as comments, chat, cards and anywhere else you would need to identify the user.

**Medium:**

**Large**: Used directly on the user's profile

Avatars use the default image _**\(include here\)**_

When users upload their avatar, they are prompted to crop the image to fit into the avatar's dimension.

## Thumbnails

Thumbnails are small versions of an image that are used as previews to content. They are often combined with other components such as cards, comments, image previews, etc.

Thumbnails are always square and \_**\(size\). **\_They do not crop the image but simply re-scale it. Thumbnails are typically left-aligned when combined with other components.
