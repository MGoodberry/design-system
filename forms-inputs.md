## Input Errors

Errors should be displayed in such a way that it is clear to the user that they have made an error, and what and where that error is.  Display the error inline with the field and explain the reason for the error.

## Inline Errors

## Validation

Fields should be validated when the user has completed the required field information but prior to the user submitting or completing the entire form.

## Required Fields

Inputs should be clearly indicated as optional or required.

If most fields in the form are required, indicate only the optional fields.

If most fields in the form are optional, indicate only the required fields.

Indications should be located beside the input field. The terms \(Required\) or \(Optional\) should be present only where necessary. Indicator text uses the colour: \#CECECE and follows the same typography design as labels.
