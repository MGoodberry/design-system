# Aurora Key Messages
Aurora is a catalogue of everything that makes up our digital products, including UI elements, writing style, guiding principles, coding standards, visual design, etc. 
Building a design system is a collaborative effort and requires expertise across all fields in web/application design. A design system takes into account all aspects of the product and encompasses all levels of the user and the creatorâ€™s experience. 
Aurora was built primarily for the Digital Collaboration Division but is open to all teams, governments and companies that wish to build interactive and digital products. 
Aurora was built in collaboration and in consultation with the Canadian Digital Service, Transport Canada, the Web Experience Toolkit, One GC team among others in the Government of Canada. 
In building Aurora, we wanted to keep the spirit of government, while providing the quality seen in the private sector. Aurora was inspired by design systems such as Google's Material Design, Shopify's Polaris, the US design system, and Clarity design system.
