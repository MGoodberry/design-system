# Data: Legends and Tooltips

In general, legends and tooltips should only be used on data sets when absolutely necessary. If enough context can provided directly on the chart or graph without obscuring data or adding a significant amount of visual clutter, a legend or tooltip is not needed.

Never use a legend if you only have one data category.

## Legends

Legends should only be used if the graph contains multiple data series. 

Legends should typically be aligned to the side of the graph, unless there is secondary axis in which case the legend should be placed at the bottom of the graph. 

Do not rely only on colour, different shapes can be used for individual data points to make the sets more distinguishable.
