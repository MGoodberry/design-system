# Tooltips

## Usage

Tooltips are text labels containing informative text that appear when users hover over, long-press, or focus an element. Tooltips provide short descriptive text about their associated element.  

## Best Practices 

Tooltips should be as short as possible and provide additional information for buttons or form inputs.

Tooltips are always used for supplemental information. Essential information that clarifies an action or demonstrates requirements for a form input, should always be immediately visible on the page.

When possible, tooltips should be placed below form inputs.
