# Buttons

## Best Practices

**\(to be moved to research section once button documentation is complete\)    
**

Buttons tend to have visual prominence on any given page or window. Primary buttons, buttons that indicate a call to action, are the most prominent. Buttons are placed where a user should expect them, i.e. in close proximity to the other elements that the action affects.

## Size and Padding

Buttons used in this design system have a minimum size of 10mm x 10mm because this is the typical size of a user's finger pad when using the application on mobile. For web this minimum size is also consistent.

The more white-space around a button, the more prominent the button is on the page. Most buttons in this system using 15px of padding. 

### Labels

Button labels should be clear and specific. Avoid generic terms like Save, Submit or Cancel. Buttons should indicate the exact action that is taken and should provide a clear idea of what happens next.

Examples of good button labels:Add a blog post, Send message, Back to menu.

All labels should capitalize only the first letter of the label.

Label text has high contrast with the button colour. See below for specific text colours for each type of button.

### Varying States

All buttons include a hover, focus, active and disabled states. _**\(describe each\)**_

Every action taken by the user will provide a user interface reaction \(colour/animation\)

## Primary Buttons

Primary buttons are meant to identify calls-to-action. Use these buttons for actions that a user is encouraged to take such as Add a blog post, Send message, or Login.Try to keep button labels limited to one or two words. 

Primary buttons are designed to have high contrast against the background and the strongest visual weight. They typically use brighter colours than other elements on the form or layout, and are located in a visible and accessible area of the page.

Primary buttons use the primary colour, with white text. Sizing of the button depends on the length of the word.

Each of the states for primary buttons are as follows:

**Regular state:**  primary colour at 100% opacity, white text, with a border radius of 4px and padding of 15px. 

**Hover state: **primary colour at 80% opacity, white text, with a border radius of 4px and padding of 15px. 

**Focus state: **primary colour at 80% opacity, white text, with a border radius of 4px and padding of 15px. Includes a 3px stroke in the primary colour. 

**Active state: **_**\(to complete\)**_

**Disabled state: **primary colour at 50% opacity, white text, with a border radius of 4px and padding of 15px.

### Position

Primary buttons should be located in the most prominent and convenient location possible. These buttons should also be located in close proximity to the form or the elements that are affected by the action. 

## Secondary Buttons

Secondary buttons are used for actions that are necessary to provide, but that users may click less often. Examples include actions such as Cancel submission, Delete or Back to menu. These buttons have a visual weight that is equal to or less than the majority of elements on the page. The secondary button is usually placed in close proximity to the primary button. Try to keep button labels limited to one or two words. 

Secondary buttons, particularly ones used for destructive actions, should be designed in a way that deters users from clicking on it. This helps minimize mistakes. 

For more permanent secondary actions, such as Delete, clicking the button may bring the user to a second window to confirm the action.

Secondary buttons are transparent with a stroke colour. Text changes colour depending on the button state. Sizing of the button depends on the length of the word.

Each of the states for primary buttons are as follows:

**Regular state: **transparent with a 1px stroke using the muted text colour \(\#666666\), the text is also written using the muted colour. Border radius of 4px and padding of 15px. 

**Hover state: **transparent with a 1px stroke using black, the text is displayed in black. Border radius of 4px and padding of 15px. 

**Focus state: **transparent with a 3px stroke using black, the text is displayed in black. Border radius of 4px and padding of 15px. 

**Active state: **_**\(to complete\)**_

**Disabled state: **_**\(to complete\) **_

### Position

Secondary buttons are usually in close proximity to the primary button, but not in a location where the user might mistake the two. Secondary buttons are usually placed to the \(left/right?\) of the primary button.

## Links

_**\(to complete, add more info about best practices\)**_

Buttons and links serve different purposes. Buttons are used for actions whereas links are to be used for navigation. 

## Split Buttons \(_**to come back to later\)**_

_**\(refer to article for standards\)**_

Multiple actions that refer to the main action on the primary button. 

Each different state follows the same design as the primary button. 

The action list. 

## Drop-Down Buttons

Two-step action. 

## Menu Buttons

\(hamburger icon\)

## Icon Buttons

_**\(to return to this when coding\)**_

i.e in WSIWYG editor, Like button, share button

Icon buttons or buttons with a dedicated shortcut \(i.e. Ctrl + S for Save\) should include a tooltip in the hover state.
