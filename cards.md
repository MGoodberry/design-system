# Cards

Cards are containers used to organize high-level content. Using cards can make your web product more appealing and navigable.

## Best Practices 

A card should only contain a single idea and feature a call-to-action, typically a click to expand on the content. The content of a card should be concise, and offer only a preview of the page they navigate to.

Cards are not always the best way to display information. 

Guide for creating a card's content:

* Main Title
* Meta information or subtitle \(time stamp, category etc.\)
* Description
* Image or Rich Media
*
