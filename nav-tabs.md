description: Use tabs to quickly navigate between views of related content.

# Nav: Tabs

Tabs organize navigation by dividing related content into separate views, within a single row, which users can quickly and easily navigate between.

## Presentation

Tabs appear in a single, non-scrollable \(i.e., fixed\) row above their associated content, where users can navigate horizontally between categories of equal importance. Tabs with related content should be grouped adjacent to each other.

### Style

An **active tab** \(i.e., a ****tab that is selected\), will display a coloured underline and a grey box around the label text. **Inactive tabs** will appear greyed out.
