# Colour

## Palettes

This colour palette consists  of primary and accent colours that can be used for illustration or to develop your brand colours. They’ve been designed to work harmoniously with each other. The colour palette starts with primary colours, and builds on hues of that colour  to create a complete and usable palette .

Themes enable consistent application styling through surface shades, shadow depth and ink opacity.

## Colours Used in This System

Elements in this system use a simple and neutral colour palette that works well across multiple applications with various branding. Colours in this system are divided into three categories: primary, secondary and accent.

Throughout the design system documentation about elements will specify which colour is used.

The palette used in this system is titled: \(name here\) and uses the following hex codes:

Primary:

Secondary:

Secondary:

## Applying Your Own Palettes

When creating your application or website you can apply your own colour palettes to various elements. When putting together your own colour combinations, it is recommended that you choose at least one primary colour, two or three secondary colours that are similar and an accent colour.

For Government of Canada applications, it is required that all colours meet the WCAG AA accessibility level. You can use online contrast checkers to ensure that the colours you choose meet accessibility standards when combined with text.

Once chosen, you can apply your own colours simply by modifying the hex codes in your CSS for various elements. For each component in this design system we identified whether we used a primary, secondary or accent colour.

## Text Colours

### Black Text

Text in this design system is displayed in an off-black colour. Black text can be used on any light background \(see: Light Theme\) or any button or element that uses a light colour. When adding text to any background that is not black it is essential to check the contrast for accessibility. Significant contrast between the background/element colour and the text ensures readability, even for those with visual impairments such as colour blindness.

Please see our typography section for more information about using text colour.

**Hex code**: 252525

### White Text

Light text in this design system is displayed in an off-white colour. White text can be used on any dark background \(see: Dark Theme\) or any button or element that uses a dark or light colour. When adding white text it is essential to check the contrast for accessibility. Significant contrast between the background/element colour and the text ensures readability, even for those with visual impairments such as colour blindness.

Please see our typography section for more information about using text colour.

\(include a do/don't image\)

**Hex code**: F8FBFD

### Muted Text

Muted text is used for secondary text elements such as captions, placeholder text and timestamps. This muted text colour only works on light backgrounds \(see: Light Theme\) or light-coloured elements. For dark backgrounds or bright/dark elements, use white text.

Please see our typography section for more information about using text colour.
