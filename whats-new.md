# What's New

Latest updates to the \#GCDigital Design System.

**April 2018**

The \#GCdigital design team is hard at work creating a first draft of the \#GCdigital design system. Browse through our Gitbook to see what's been done so far and what we're still working on!

The first phase of the design system will focus on key design elements, and a downloadable user interface \(UI\) kit. We are finishing the last few elements related to navigation, data visualizations and animations, as well as reviewing previous work.

Development work for the design elements will start mid-May. Interested in helping us code our components? [Contact us!](mailto:%20sierra.duffey@tbs-sct.gc.ca)
