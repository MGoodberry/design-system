# Ratings/Likes

Including the option to like and rate content in your web products allows for greater user interaction.

## Likes

_**Are like buttons primary or secondary buttons?**_

The "like" function should use commonly understood symbols such as a thumbs up or a heart. Note that these two symbols have slightly different implications; a thumbs up implies approval while a heart suggests a personal enjoyment. Use whichever makes more sense in the context of the content. Including the word "like" on your like buttons improves accessibility.

"Liking" should be a binary on/off function. Avoid using negative functions such as "dislike" as this may dissuade users from creating new content, or may give an overall negative impression of your product.

Including a counter on like buttons can improve the community aspect of your product, as users can see how many people have positively reacted to the content. _**Can people see who has liked the content?**_
