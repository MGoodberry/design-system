# Menus

Menus are used to display lists of choices the user can select \(**parallelism?**\). Menus can be used for lists of actions, as well as a form of navigation.

## Best Practices

Menus must contain at least two items, and each item should only be a single line of text. Menus can be exited by clicking outside of the menu, or by selecting the action, unless multiple actions can be selected, or selecting a navigation point. Menus should typically only have one level of nesting. 

-Ordering -- static vs dynamic

-Nesting -- no more than one level, ideally

-location -- top level \(emitting element -- for context\)

-Dismissing -- click outside, or select item \(not if multiple items can be selected\)

## Action Menus \(need different name\)

-temporary

-interaction w/control

-discrete

-scroll internally

-disabled are still shown, just unclickable

and checkboxes. \(Do we want different symbols for multiple items vs different states?\). Disabled items should still be shown in an unclickable state.



Menu items can be ordered either statically or dynamically based on their 

-Ordering -- static vs dynamic

#### Labels

-concisely and accurately

#### Contextual

-dynamic

### Cascading Menus

-desktop

#### Inline

### Simple Menus

-mobile or tablet

-vertical

-nesting is vertically aligned on top of selected item

-left aligned

## Navigation Menus

### Menu Bar \(merge w/tabs? or vice versa?\)

### Mega-menus

-type of expendable menu

-**subcategories** \(what makes it different from other menus\)

-two dimensional, groups of navigation items

-structured

-static

-everything is visible at once

#### Timing

### Static \(merge w/sidebar? or vice versa?\)

## Hybrid
