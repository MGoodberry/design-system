# Data: Tables

Data tables are used to show a large amount of discreet data with multiple categories. Data can be filtered and ordered using a data table.

## Best Practices 

Data tables should allow for the direction of the data, typically ascending and descending, to be changed for each category.

A button to change the page the user is on should appear on the bottom left if there are multiple pages, with the current page indicated.

Data tables can also have a search function to lookup an individual data point. Search bars should appear at the top of the table. Data tables can include the option to change how many data points appear on an individual page. If using this function, you should indicate what range of data the user is looking at. You can add additional options for the data table as a whole. Place these options in the top right of the table.
