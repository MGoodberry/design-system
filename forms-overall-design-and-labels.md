# Form Design and Labels

## Design

Forms should be designed vertically as this improves their scanability. When possible, a form should be one column.

Information can be presented in multiple columns if they are grouped together \(i.e. first name and last name fields\).

Inputs should be grouped and sequenced in the most logical way possible. If multiple inputs are required for one grouping of information \(i.e. street address, postal code, and province\), these inputs should be placed in close proximity to each other.

Typically forms start with the most important or common information such as username, password, first or last name, email address, etc.

For complicated forms, information should be displayed using multiple steps or pages. If this is the case, it is important to include a progress bar throughout the form, as well as a way to navigate both forwards and backwards between steps.

## Labels

Users need to be able to easily read labels and intuitively understand how the label is related to its field. Labels should use clear but concise language, and provide enough information for the user to accurately complete the required information.

If additional information is necessary beyond a label, this information should be displayed in a separate tooltip or text field. Additional information on how to complete the field might also be provided as placeholder text.

### Placement of Labels

Labels should follow the vertical format of the form. Place labels above their respective field. Group a label with its field so that there is a clear distinction between fields. **Do not use placeholder text for labels as this prevents the user from properly reviewing the form. \(possible conflict with previous paragraph\).**

### Text in Labels

How labels are written affects their legibility. Do not write labels in all caps as this diminishes their readability. Labels should not be the same as placeholder text, they should both be separate. Donâ€™t use symbols to represent required content.

## Placeholder Text

Placeholder text is text that appears directly in the input field. This text is not meant to be used as a label, but can provide supplemental information or an example for the user.

Placeholder text is meant to help the user more accurately complete the field rather than be the primary indicator of field content.

As soon as the user starts typing in the field, the placeholder text should disappear.
