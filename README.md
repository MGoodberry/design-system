# \#GCDigital Design System

The Digital Collaboration Division \(GCTools\) will be building a design system to standardize the visual elements, components, communications and overall user experience of our digital collaboration tools. 

This project is happening in parallel to a rebuild of our digital products, which includes moving our suite of tools to a micro-service architecture. Both projects will inform each other and work together to update both the developmental framework and user interface and design of our tools. 

This design system is built in collaboration with multiple teams and departments \(Canadian Digital Service, Talent Cloud, IRCC\), and will be available for any Government of Canada or external teams that wish to use the system to build their own products.
