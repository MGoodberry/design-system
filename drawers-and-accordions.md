# Drawers and Accordions

Accordions are vertically stacked menus, with content nested in headers. Clicking a header either shows or hides content. Using accordions reduces scrolling, and makes the task of reading a page less daunting for the user as they can more easily locate the content they want to find. 

## Best Practices 

Accordions can be used for navigation or for information. 

Accordions should only be used when content is discrete, do not use if points of content overlap. Accordions are best when the user would be only looking for no more than a few points of content. If it is likely the user would need to click on several of the headers, it is better to show all of the information on the same page.
