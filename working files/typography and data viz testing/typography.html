<h2> An Animator from Scarborough </h2> <p class="stamp"> Posted yesterday </p>
<p> Over 1500 applications from around the world flood George Lucas’s animation academy each year (Lucas created the Star Wars films), but only four applicants are selected for internships. Randolph Lizarda, 21, from Scarborough, was one of them.
    <br> 
    <br>
“I’m very excited. I’ll be working in the LucasArts division animating video games, although I don’t know what we’re working on. They wouldn’t tell me – it’s confidential,” Lizarda said on a break from his Sheridan College class.

As a child, Lizarda liked to draw cartoons. Now he is learning to transfer his drawing ability to the computer. 
    <br>
     <br>
"I was into [art] when I was little; then I got more into it in high school. In Grade 10, I took one of those career surveys to find out where you fit in. I fit into the animation industry," he said. </p>

<p> Lizarda aspires to one day work for an animation company such as Pixar or DreamWorks. 
“He’s an excellent student,” said Dave Quesnelle, who teaches animation and is one of Lizarda’s professors. Lizarda stood out after handing in his first assignment, a 10-second action sequence of a muscular circus performer balancing on a ball before jumping through a hoop of fire. This clip was the first segment on the demo reel he submitted to LucasFilm.

“I had a really good sense of his storytelling. He had the basic principles of animation [but] it was also comical. And that’s our job. Anyone can make a picture move, but to make it entertaining, that’s the craft of an animator.” </p>
