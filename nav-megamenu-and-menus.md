# Menus

Menus are used to display lists of choices the user can select. Menus can be used for lists of actions, as well as a form of navigation.

## Best Practices

Menus must contain at least two items, and each item should only be a single line of text. Menus can be exited by clicking outside of the menu, or by selecting the action, unless multiple actions can be selected, or selecting a navigation point. Menus should be labeled clearly and concisely. Menus should typically only have one level of nesting. 

Interaction w/button?  -Temporary? \(Are we counting menu bars as menus?\)

## Action Menus \(need different name\)

### Best Practices

Action menus are temporary lists of choices a user can make. They can consist of both** primary actions** and options which affect the page. Menu items can contain icons, and checkboxes.  **\(Do we want different symbols for multiple items vs different states?\). **Menus should be internally scrollable. 

Action menus can be static or contextual. Static menus have fixed options; contextual menus change their options based on what is available to select. Menu items can be ordered either statically \(always in the same order\) or dynamically \(changing based on previous user interaction\).

## Navigation Menus

### Best Practices

### Menu Bar \(merge w/tabs? or vice versa?\)

### Mega-menus

Mega-menus are used when your navigation points have subcategories. The navigation points are grouped together with like items, under a title header. All items should be visible at the same time. Mega-menus can have multiple columns.
